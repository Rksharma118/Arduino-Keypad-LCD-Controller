# Arduino Keypad-LCD Controller
## Overview
The Arduino Keypad-LCD Controller is a project that utilizes an Arduino Uno R3, an LCD display, and a keypad to create an interactive user interface. This system allows users to input data via the keypad and view the results or messages on the LCD screen. The project can be adapted for various applications, such as menu navigation, data entry, and custom displays.

## Components
Arduino Uno R3
16x2 LCD Display
4x4 Matrix Keypad
Breadboard and Jumper Wires
220Î© Resistor (for LCD backlight, if needed)

## Features
Keypad Input: Use a 4x4 matrix keypad for data entry and menu navigation.
LCD Display: View input data, messages, or system status on a 16x2 LCD display.
Interactive Interface: Respond to user inputs and update the display in real-time.
Circuit Diagram
The circuit diagram for the project is as follows:

## LCD Connections:

VSS to Arduino GND
VDD to Arduino 5V
VO to a potentiometer (for contrast adjustment)
RS to Arduino pin 12
RW to Arduino GND
E to Arduino pin 11
D0-D3 (not used) to Arduino GND
D4-D7 to Arduino pins 5, 4, 3, 2 respectively
A (LED Anode) to Arduino 5V (through a resistor if needed)
K (LED Cathode) to Arduino GND

## Keypad Connections:

Rows (1-4) to Arduino pins 9, 8, 7, 6 respectively
Columns (1-4) to Arduino pins A0, A1, A2, A3 respectively

## Usage
Power On: Connect the Arduino to your computer or a power source using a USB cable.
Input Data: Press keys on the 4x4 matrix keypad.
View Output: Observe the result on the 16x2 LCD display.
